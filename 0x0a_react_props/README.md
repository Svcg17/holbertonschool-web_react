   - How to define types for components
   - How to use Fragments
   - When to use a key to improve a loop’s performance

## Tasks
### [0. Basic components](./task_0)
Start with your files from the last task of the 0x02. React intro project

Instead of creating new elements, we’re going to create components to split the project. The App.js is going to become the main entry point, the shell, for every component in the app.
Create a Header component

Create a new folder Header:

  -  Move the code of the header from the App.js to a new file Header.js
  -  Move the css code, related to the header, of the App.css to a new file named Header.css
  -  Create an empty Header.test.js. We’ll add tests for it later.

Create a Footer component

Create a new folder Footer:

  -  Move the code of the footer from the App.js to a new file Footer.js
  -  Move the css code, related to the footer, of the App.css to a new file named Footer.css
  -  Create a Footer.test.js, we will add the tests later

Create a Login component

Create a new folder Login:

  -  Move the code of the login section from the App.js to a new file Login.js
  -  The code should be wrapped in a React Fragment
  -  Move the css code, related to the login, of the App.css to a new file named Login.css
  -  Create a Login.test.js, we will add the tests later

Modify the shell

In the index.html:

  -  Remove the root-notifications
  -  Remove the Notifications import

In the App.js:

  - Import Notifications, Login, Footer, and Header
  - Add the new Notifications component before the div.App element
  - Wrap Notifications and the rest of the div.App within a React Fragment
  -  In the div.App, replace the header code by the new Header component
  - In the div.App-body, replace the login code by the new Login component
  - In the div.App-footer, replace the footer code by the new Footer component

In the App.test.js:

   - Most tests will fail, only keep the one testing that the component renders without crashing

Requirements:

   - At this point, reloading the App should display the exact same page as the last task
   - The console in your browser should not show any error or warning
